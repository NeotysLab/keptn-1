# Release Notes 0.6.0 SLI (SLI Sta'lone)

This release focuses on improvements of the **Keptn Quality Gates** capability that allows the evaluation of **Service Level Objectives** (SLOs), which are determined by **Service Level Indicators** (SLI). For these improvements, the **Lighthouse** service has been introduced, which is a service that is responsible for conducting an evaluation based on data from SLI-providers. The Lighthouse service supersedes Pitometer.
Furthermore, the following highlights should be noticed:

- Due to user demand, Keptn Quality Gates is now available as a standalone feature. That allows enriching existing CD pipelines with quality gates that ensure that services are only promoted if they meet defined SLOs. To integrate Keptn in an existing pipeline, REST endpoints are provided to trigger an evaluation and to pull the evaluation results.d

- The Keptn Quality Gates capability doesn't require deployment and testing features. We've provided an installation option in the Keptn installer (`keptn install ... --use-case=quality-gates`) that excludes the deployment and testing components, which results in a smaller resource footprint.

- The Keptn's bridge has been enhanced for better visibility into evaluation results. Thus, it is possible to see why an SLO has not been met.

- Due to the flexible architecture of Keptn, it is possible to exchange an SLI-provider and gather data for the quality gate from another monitoring or testing provider.

## Good to know / known limitations

- There is no new-artifact cloud event - `keptn send event new-artifact` causes a configuration change event [#1218](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1218)
- Currently, Helm v2 is used, which is now entering maintenance mode as Helm v3 has been released. This means that Helm v2 is going to be unmaintained at the end of 2020 (Source: https://helm.sh/blog/2019-10-22-helm-2150-released/#helm-2-support-plan ).
- Currently, CloudEvents v0.2 is used. We aim to implement v1.0 in the future which will cause changes in our CloudEvents handling. [#1178](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1178)
- Using an Apache Proxy with `ProxyPreserveHost on` in blue-green deployment scenario fails because of Istio Envoy/Proxy
- Distributors can not automatically reconnect to NATS cluster [#1209](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1209) 
- Dynatrace SLI Service / Metrics API will change at the end of Q1 [#1282](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1282) 
- Sending multiple new-artifacts events can cause problems which result in a "no healthy upstream" error [#1229](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1229), [#1219](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1219)
- Istio can potentially cause the kube-apiserver to experience downtimes (see https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/19481 ) [#1298](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1298)
- The Quality-gates standalone version is currently not supported on OpenShift and PKS [#1197](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/1197)
